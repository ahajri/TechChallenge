# Angular 2 + MarkLogic 

This sample shows how to create an angular 2 app that:
* Has **lots of different routes**
* Performs **authentication with JWTs**
* **Calls APIs** authenticated and not.
* Extends the **RouterOutlet** for route pipeline changes.

> You can **learn more about how it works [in this blogpost](https://auth0.com/blog/2015/05/14/creating-your-first-real-world-angular-2-app-from-authentication-to-calling-an-api-and-everything-in-between/)**

## Running it

First, run the server app in the port `3001`.

Then, run `npm install` on this project and run `npm start` to start the app. Then just navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) :boom:
Use `npm run server` to run API server.
